Deployment of LightREST server on a new machine.

Build the LightStack solution in Release mode to populate this folder with the latest files. 
Then follow the steps below to set the server up on another machine. 
The only pre-requiesite is that the machine has .NET4 installed.



1. Create a folder to contain the files in this folder and copy them into the folder.
2. The database file is assumed to be named "Badges.db" and located in the "My Documents" folder of the account that the server will be running in. 
3. Open a command window and set the current directory to the installed folder
4. Run SqliteBootStrap to create the database
5. Create the namespace reservation for the port with:
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8088/ user=Everyone
6. Start the LightREST server.
7. Use RestTester to perform a few tests: see below.
8. Installation and testing should be complete.

*** RestTester commands to test the server. ***

resttester GET http://localhost:8088/Badges/1

- To get a JSON string in the correct format to create POST data
